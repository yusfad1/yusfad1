# 👋 Hey there, I'm Youssef!

🚀 **Data & Software Engineer | Cloud Enthusiast | Building the Next-Gen of Data Tools**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a passionate engineer with a mission to craft **scalable**, **cloud-native**, and **intelligent** data platforms that power the future of analytics and AI. Whether it’s designing infrastructure as code, building modern data pipelines, or developing backend services, I thrive where **data meets code**.

- 🌐 **Data Engineering** – Building ELT pipelines, real-time streaming, data lakes & warehouses using tools like Apache Airflow, Dagster, Iceberg, and more.
- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure** – Deploying and managing systems on AWS using Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- 🧠 **Smart Systems** – Prototyping graph-based and AI-driven tools for deeper data understanding (hello, GraphRAG 👋).
- 💻 **Software Engineering** – Writing robust APIs, automating workflows, and delivering performant backend systems with Python & FastAPI.
